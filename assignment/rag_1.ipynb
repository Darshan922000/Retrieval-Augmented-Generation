Attackers craft subtle, often imperceptible perturbations to data that lead the model to make errors. This technique exposes vulnerabilities in the model's training or logic and can be used to undermine AI system security. Defending against model tricking requires robust training with adversarial examples, rigorous testing, and the deployment of detection mechanisms to identify and rectify such attempts at deception, thereby ensuring the AI system's reliability and trustworthiness.\\n\\nVisibility and control are crucial components of AI security posture management. To effectively manage the security posture of AI and ML systems, organizations need to have a clear understanding of their AI models, the data used in these models, and the associated infrastructure. This includes having visibility into the AI supply chain, data pipelines, and cloud environments. With visibility, organizations can identify potential risks, misconfigurations, and compliance issues. Control allows organizations to take corrective action, such as implementing security policies, remediating vulnerabilities, and managing access to AI resources.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning can create security blind spots due to the nature of AI systems, the pace of adoption, and the amount of data involved. As organizations deploy AI and ML models across diverse cloud environments, the traditional security tools and approaches may not adequately address the unique risks associated with these models. For example, data poisoning attacks or adversarial examples can exploit the AI model's behavior, leading to compromised outputs. Additionally, the dynamic and interconnected nature of AI systems can make it difficult to track and secure data, resulting in potential data exposure and compliance issues.\\n\\nModel corruption refers to the process of altering or tampering with an AI model's parameters, training data, or functionality, which can lead to compromised performance or malicious outputs. Attackers may corrupt models through data poisoning, adversarial examples, or other techniques that manipulate the model's behavior. AI model misuse, on the other hand, occurs when threat actors or unauthorized users exploit AI models for malicious purposes, such as generating deepfakes, enabling automated attacks, or circumventing security measures. Both model corruption and misuse can undermine the integrity, security, and trustworthiness of AI systems.\\n\\nRelated Content\\n\\nAI-SPM Ensures Security and Compliance of AI-Powered Applications\\n\\nLearn AI model discovery and inventory, data exposure prevention, and posture and risk analysis in this AI-SPM datasheet.\\n\\nSecuring the Data Landscape with DSPM and DDR\\n\\nStay ahead of the data security risks.
